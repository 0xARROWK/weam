Description: Upload progress system for Nginx
 Upload progress module is an implementation of an upload progress system, that
 monitors RFC1867 POST uploads as they are transmitted to upstream servers.
 .
 It works by tracking the uploads proxied by Nginx to upstream servers without
 analysing the uploaded content and offers a web API to report upload progress
 in Javscript, Json or any other format.
